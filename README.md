# Godot-Steam-Playfab-Tutorial
This is a repository containing the code for the corresponding tutorial on youtube : https://youtu.be/ZZgrGiyoCTQ

This repository is a basic implementation of a **Godot Game server** running on **Playfab** with a **Godot Game client** lauched by **Steam** that connects to a **Lobby server**.

The repository is being separated into 3 projects (1 per folder).

# Disclaimer
This code does not intend to be a bullet proof neither fully secure implementation but rather a tutorial on how to do it. A lot of things can be improved for an actual game.

# Lobby server
To start the lobby server (and watch files for modifications), open a terminal under the LobbyServer folder and run the command:

```
dotnet watch run
```

# Game client
You will have to update the port of the lobby server to the one you actually use.

Enjoy (:
